```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## Read Dataset
```{r Read in data}
fraud <- read.csv("fraud_data.csv")
summary(fraud)
```

Data conversions needed:
- trans_data_trans time: separate into date + time

Run some exploratory analysis
- maybe PCA??
- make a plot of fraud by longtidue/latitude coordinates (sender and merchant)
- some other plots

Run logistic regression
- split into training + test sets
- run lasso logistic regression model
- look at variance, accuracy, etc.
- if dataset is unbalanced, balance and run again

Time Series Modeling
- amount over time
