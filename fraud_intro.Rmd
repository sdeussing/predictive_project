```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Read Dataset
```{r Read in data}
fraud <- read.csv("fraud_data.csv")
summary(fraud)
```

Data conversions needed:
- trans_data_trans time: separate into date + time
- category: make factor
- city: make factor
- state: make factor
- is_fraud: make factor

Split into training + test sets

Run some exploratory analysis: maybe PCA?

Run logistic regression
